Shutengu!! 1.0.1
================

**Space pilots have to survive through even the harshest of space weather. Not even the most alert, prudent pilot can passively avoid collisions with space debris. It takes sharp reflexes and tireless observance. And the vigorous space training begins in the Shutengu Survival Simulator.**

Shutengu!! is a bullet hell shooter with a sick tech theme. Dodge through waves of bullets with intricate, dense patterns while listening to rockin' music. This game simply doesn't end; it continually increases in difficulty until you lose.
