Shutengu!!
==========

(branch test)

The bullet hell GitHub needs.
-----------------------------
You are a little ship shooting a lot of bullets. You fight hordes of other little ships that shoot bullets, and sometimes huge ships that shoot way more bullets than you do. Enemy bullets fly in intricate, dense patterns, and precise dodging is a must. This is an arcade-style endless game, so once an enemy is defeated, more will take its place until you lose.

Some semblance of gameplay.
---------------------------
Arrows to move. Shift to activate bombs. Z to shoot. X to focus.  
Collect points falling from enemies to boost your score and gain extra lives and powerups.  
Get out of trouble by clearing out enemy bullets with bombs.  
Focus to slow down and increase shooting accuracy. Helps when precision is needed.  

The gimmicks to look for.
-------------------------
* Bullet patterns generated on-the-fly thanks to BulletML
* Constantly-adapting difficulty to challenge and not frustrate players
  * If scoring better than expected score, increase difficulty
  * If lives have not been lost in a long time, increase difficulty
* Great music from possibly Mesu Kasumai, Bin√§rpilot, Nullsleep and/or Twilight Electric
